My name is Muhamad Nasir Lukman, I am passionate in earth science and intereseted in so much new things that I can explore as a geoscientist using pyhon and open source GIS. 

I am currently working as exploration geologist and mineplan engineer in a mining company and in my free time I like to learn and explore about machine learning and remote sensing. I intended to use this blog as a place to keep new things that I learn or something that I find intersting or useful. 

Feel free to contact me via email or any other social media from the links at the bottom at the page!
