My name is Muhamad Nasir Lukman, I am currently working as exploration geologist and mineplan engineer in a mining company and in my free time I like to learn and explore about the use of python and GIS in earth science. I intended to use this blog as a place to keep new things that I learn or something that I find intersting or useful. 

Feel free to contact me via email or any other social media from the links at the bottom at the page!
